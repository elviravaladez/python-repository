Variables

* Recommended to use lowercase names
* Cannot start with a number
* No spaces. An underscore is recommended instead: _
* Does not allow certain symbols
* Python is dynamically typed
  * You can reassign variables to different data types
  * Python is very flexible in assigning data types

### Continued Development

This section will outline areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects.
