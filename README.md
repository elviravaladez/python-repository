## Overview

### The Objective

Understand the fundamentals of Python.

## My Process

### Built With

- Python
- IntelliJ IDEA

### What I Learned

This section will be updated to include some of my major learnings while learning Python. I will be writing these out and providing code samples of areas I would like to highlight to reinforce my knowledge. When major learnings are shared, they will look similar to the code snippet below üòä

```python
print('Some Python code I am proud of üêç')
```

### Continued Development

This section will outline areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects.
