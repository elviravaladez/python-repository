## Overview

### The Objective

Understand the fundamentals of Python.

## My Process

### Built With

- Python
- IntelliJ IDEA

### What I Learned

#### Data Types

|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Integers 🔢|int|Whole numbers, such as: 1, 120, 300|
|Floating Point 🎈|float|Numbers with a decimal point 1.2, 120.5, 500.0|
|Strings 🧵|str|Ordered sequence of characters: "hi" 'hola' '4029'|
|Lists 📝|list|Ordered sequence of objects: [50,"hola",512.0]|
|Dictionaries 📕|dict|Unordered Key:Value pairs: {"mykey":"value","name":"Elvira"}|
|Tuples 🛁|tup|Ordered immutable sequence of objects:(23,"hola",313.4)|
|Sets 👡👠|set|Unordered collection of unique objects: {"a","b"}|
|Booleans ✅ 🚫️|bool|Logical value indicating True or False|


#### Variables

* It is recommended that variable names be lowercase
* Cannot start with a number
* No spaces. An underscore is recommended instead: _
* Does not allow certain symbols
* Python is dynamically typed
  * You can reassign variables to different data types
  * Python is very flexible in assigning data types

#### Strings

Today I learned that Python has reverse indexing. One example of when this can be useful is when you want to grab the last letter of a string. In this case, you would use -1.

### Continued Development

This section will outline areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects.
