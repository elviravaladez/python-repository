# Strings are sequences of characters, using the syntax of either single or double quotes
# Example:
# 'hey'
# "Hey"
# " I don't just like Python. I love it! "

# Strings are ORDERED SEQUENCES
# Uses indexing and slicing to grab sub-sections of the string

# These actions use [] square brackets and a number index to indicate postions of what you wish to grab

#     Character: h  e  l  l  o
#         Index: 0  1  2  3  4
# Reverse Index: 0 -4 -3 -2 -1
